-> The project involves using IBM Machine Learning and IBM Watson Studio with an Auto-AI experiment that includes 8 algorithms. From these, the 
   best-performing algorithm is selected for deployment.
   
-> The Node-Red starter kit is utilized to build the user interface (UI), allowing users/customers to input their details and receive predictions.

-> Various charts, such as Line Graphs and Bar Graphs, are used to visually display the energy output predictions, helping users better understand 
   the predicted values.
